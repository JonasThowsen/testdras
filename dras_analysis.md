# DRAS System Analysis and Improvement Opportunities

## Current System Overview

**DRAS** (DMMHs ressursadministrasjonssystem) is a resource administration system for DMMH (Det Medisinske Fakultet) that implements guidelines for resource allocation to work tasks for academic positions.

### Key Features of Current System:
1. **Academic Year Management** - Critical feature where users select study year from top menu
2. **Course Management** - Handles subjects/courses for different study programs  
3. **Teaching Assignment Management** - Manages teaching tasks and responsibilities
4. **Examination & Grading** - Handles exam administration and grading resources
5. **Staff Management** - Manages academic personnel and their assignments
6. **Reporting System** - Generates various reports for resource allocation
7. **Department/Section Management** - Organizes institutional structure

### Current System Limitations Identified:

#### User Experience Issues:
- **Complex Navigation** - Multiple menu levels and year-dependent contexts
- **Date Format Constraints** - Requires specific YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Decimal Format Issues** - Mix of decimal point/comma causing confusion
- **Manual CSV Uploads** - Exam data requires manual CSV file uploads with strict formatting

#### Technical Issues:
- **Year-Specific Dependencies** - Many elements tied to specific academic years
- **Manual Data Entry** - Heavy reliance on manual input prone to errors
- **Limited Real-time Updates** - No mention of real-time collaboration features
- **CSV Upload Bottlenecks** - Exam information requires complex CSV formatting

#### Administrative Burden:
- **Complex Setup Process** - New academic year setup requires multiple manual steps
- **Role-Based Complexity** - Different interfaces for administrators vs daily users
- **Manual Synchronization** - No automated sync with study plans or exam schedules

## Proposed MVP Improvements

### 1. **Streamlined Academic Year Management**
- Automatic academic year progression
- Simplified year switching with clear visual indicators
- Bulk operations across multiple years

### 2. **Modern Course & Assignment Management**
- Drag-and-drop interface for assigning staff to courses
- Real-time collaboration for multiple administrators
- Template-based course creation

### 3. **Intelligent Data Import/Export**
- Smart CSV parsing with error correction suggestions
- Integration APIs for study plan systems
- Automated exam schedule import

### 4. **Enhanced Reporting & Analytics**
- Interactive dashboards for resource visualization
- Predictive analytics for workload planning
- Export to modern formats (Excel, PDF, JSON)

### 5. **Improved User Experience**
- Modern, responsive web interface
- Role-based dashboards
- Smart date pickers and form validation
- Real-time notifications and updates

## Technical Implementation Strategy

The MVP will focus on the core workflow: **Academic Year Setup → Course Management → Staff Assignment → Resource Reporting**

This covers the most critical pain points while providing immediate value to users.
